## Data Visualization
Here, I'm creating a plot with the data mpg.
* x axis: displ
* y axis: hwy
With ggplot() function, you can add various layers to the basic plot using + sign.
1. ggplot(): the dataset to use in the graph. This generates an empty graph. So we need layers to specify the plot.
```{r basic plot}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg)
# ggplot(mpg) means the same
```


2. So one or more layers are required to complete the plot. Layers that to be added will specify the graph.
```{r data loading and basic plotting}
ggplot(mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(displ, hwy))
```
Here, I specified the type of plot and the axes.
The function geom_point() adds a layer of points to the empty plot created by ggplot(mgp).
The points added create a scatterplot.
So, if you add a different layer instead of geom_point, you'll get a different type of plot.
Every geom function requires a mapping argument.
Simply speaking, this argument defines how the variables of your choice will be mapped in your graph. (x and y axis)
The mapping() argument is always with aes() which specifies x and y axis respectively.
